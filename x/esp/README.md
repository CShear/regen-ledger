# ESP module

The ESP (ecological state protocol) module provides a global geo-tagged, ledger of ecological health. ESP's are managed
by curating organizations (managed by the [agent](../agent/README.md) module) and can evolve through various versions
as the curating organization refines its verification methodology. Curators are responsible for defining approved
verifiers and a schema for ESP results. All ESP results include a geo-polygon that allows the data stored in the
ESP result registry to be projected onto a map for visualization of global ecological health.

# Data Module

This module provides very basic support for hashing and time-stamping data onto
the blockchain. It serves the purpose of providing a way that any piece of data
can be tracked onto the blockchain for a fee and known to have existed at or
before some given block-height. It is intended that this module will mostly
be supplanted by other more domain specific functionality and/or
enhanced with robust, opt-in schema-validation support in the future.
